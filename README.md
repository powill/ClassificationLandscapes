Visualizations of machine learning predictions trained on morphed images and interpolated data 

This project was presented at the Conference of Information Science and Systems 2023 at John Hopkins University, and published on [IEEE Xplore] the Conference Proceedings of the 2023 57th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS): [](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10089673)


This project uses an [Automatic Image Morphing](https://github.com/jankovicsandras/autoimagemorph) tool developed by [Andr√°s Jankovics](https://github.com/jankovicsandras), which was adapted from a [Python Image Morpher](https://github.com/ddowd97/Morphing) developed by [David Dowd](https://github.com/ddowd97)

# ClassificationLandscapes
Visualizations of machine learning predictions trained on morphed images and interpolated data, in collaboration with Lin Shi and Larry Liebovitch, Ph.D. 

This project was presented at the Conference of Information Science and Systems 2023 at John Hopkins University, and published on the Conference Proceedings of the 2023 57th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS): [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10089673](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10089673)

This project uses an [Automatic Image Morphing](https://github.com/jankovicsandras/autoimagemorph) tool developed by Andr√°s Jankovics, which was adapted from a [Python Image Morpher](https://github.com/ddowd97/Morphing) developed by David Dowd.

The data used for analysis and visualization include: 
- [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset by Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul and Roland Vollgraf. [arXiv:1708.07747](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07747)
- [IRIS](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) dataset by R.A. Fisher
- [Three Hawks](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/blob/master/csv/Stat2Data/Hawks.csv)

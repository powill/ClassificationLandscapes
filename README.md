Visualizations of machine learning predictions trained on morphed images and interpolated data 

This project uses an [Automatic Image Morphing](https://github.com/jankovicsandras/autoimagemorph) tool developed by [Andr√°s Jankovics](https://github.com/jankovicsandras), which was adapted from a [Python Image Morpher](https://github.com/ddowd97/Morphing) developed by [David Dowd](https://github.com/ddowd97)
